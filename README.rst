Django States
=============

|Build Status|

Description
-----------

State engine for django models. Define a state graph for a model and
remember the state of each object. State transitions can be logged for
objects.

Installation
------------

.. code:: sh

    pip install django-states2

Usage example
-------------

To use a state machine, you should add a state field to the model

.. code:: python

    from django_states.fields import StateField
    from django_states.machine import StateMachine, StateDefinition, StateTransition

    class PurchaseStateMachine(StateMachine):
       log_transitions = True

       # possible states
       class initiated(StateDefinition):
           description = _('Purchase initiated')
           initial = True

       class paid(StateDefinition):
           description = _('Purchase paid')

           def handler(self, instance):
               code_to_execute_when_arriving_in_this_state()

       class shipped(StateDefinition):
           description = _('Purchase shipped')

       class canceled(StateDefinition):
           description = _('Purchase canceled')

       # state transitions
       class mark_paid(StateTransition):
           from_state = 'initiated'
           to_state = 'paid'
           description = 'Mark this purchase as paid'

       class ship(StateTransition):
           from_state = 'paid'
           to_state = 'shipped'
           description = 'Ship purchase'

           def handler(transition, instance, user):
               code_to_execute_during_this_transition()

           def has_permission(transition, instance, user):
               return true_when_user_can_make_this_transition()

       class cancel(StateTransition):
           from_states = ['initiated', 'paid']
           to_state = 'canceled'
           description = 'Mark this purchase as canceled'

    class Purchase(StateModel):
        purchase_state = StateField(machine=PurchaseStateMachine, default='initiated')
        #... (other fields for a purchase)

If ``log_transitions`` is enabled, another model is created. Everything
should be compatible with South\_ for migrations.

Note: If you're creating a ``DataMigration`` in
`South <http://south.aeracode.org/>`__, remember to use
``obj.save(no_state_validation=True)``

Usage example:

.. code:: python

   p = Purchase()

   # Will automatically create state object for this purchase, in the
   # initial state.
   p.save()
   p.get_purchase_state_info().make_transition('mark_paid', request.user) # User parameter is optional
   p.purchase_state # Will return 'paid'
   p.get_purchase_state_info().description # Will return 'Purchase paid'

   # Returns an iterator of possible transitions for this purchase.
   p.get_purchase_state_info().possible_transitions()

   # Which can be used like this..
   [x.get_name() for x in p.possible_transitions]

For better transition control, override:

-  ``has_permission(self, instance, user)``: Check whether this user is
   allowed to make this transition.
-  ``handler(self, instance, user)``: Code to run during this
   transition. When an exception has been raised in here, the transition
   will not be made.

Get all objects in a certain state::

   Purchase.objects.filter(purchase_state='initiated')

Validation
----------

You can add a test that needs to pass before a state transition can be
executed. Well, you can add 2: one based on the current user
(``has_permission``) and one generic (``validate``).

So on a ``StateTransition``-object you need to specify an extra
``validate`` function (signature is ``validate(cls, instance)``). This
should yield ``TransitionValidationError``, this way you can return
multiple errors on that need to pass before the transition can happen.

The ``has_permission`` function (signature
``has_permission(transition, instance, user)``) should check whether the
given user is allowed to make the transition. E.g. a super user can
moderate all comments while other users can only moderate comments on
their blog-posts.

Groups
------

Sometimes you want to group several states together, since for a certain
view (or other content) it doesn't really matter which of the states it
is. We support 2 different state groups, inclusive (only these) or
exclusive (everything but these):

.. code:: python

  class is_paid(StateGroup):
      states = ['paid', 'shipped']

  class is_paid(StateGroup):
      exclude_states = ['initiated']

State graph
-----------

You can get a graph of your states by running the ``graph_states``
management command.

.. code:: sh

   python manage.py graph_states myapp.Purchase.state

This requires `graphviz <http://graphviz.org>`__ and python bindings for
graphviz: ``pygraphviz`` and ``yapgvb``.
